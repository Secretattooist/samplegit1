    <p>The core element of a web page is a text file written in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML)[2] that describes the content of the web page and includes references to other web resources. A web page is a structured document that primarily consists of hypertext, text with hyperlinks. Hyperlinks point the user to other web resources, primarily other web pages, and to different sections of the same web page. Multimedia <span>content on the web, such as images, videos, and other web pages, can be directly embedded in a web page to form a compound document.</span></p>
