    <h1>Tata Altroz</h1>
    <p>The Tata Altroz was tested by the Global NCAP in 2020 (similar to Latin NCAP 2013) in its basic safety specification of two airbags and ISOFIX anchorages as standard. It achieved five stars for adult occupant protection (becoming the second Indian car to do so)[8] and three stars for child occupant protection. Its structure was rated as capable of withstanding further loadings. The car does not offer ESC or side airbags on <span>any variant and does not offer three-point seatbelts in all seating positions (Tata offers Corner Stability Control on all variants but this has limited functionality when compared to ESC).</span></p>
